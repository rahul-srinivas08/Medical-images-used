Medical images working on 
DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine):
Industry Standard: DICOM is widely adopted in the medical industry, particularly in radiology, and is commonly used by various medical imaging devices.
Rich Metadata: It contains comprehensive metadata, including patient information, imaging parameters, and detailed acquisition specifics.
Structure: DICOM organizes data by packing multiple 2D slices to construct a 3D image, making it suitable for volumetric medical images.
Usage: DICOM is the preferred format for clinical applications and seamless integration with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).

NIFTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative):
Brain Imaging Focus: NIFTI is primarily designed to meet the requirements of the neuroimaging community, particularly in brain imaging research.
Structure: It employs a single-file storage approach, accommodating 3D or 4D data, which includes time-series data, simplifying data management.
Header Information: NIFTI files include header information that encapsulates spatial and temporal metadata, enhancing its usability for research purposes.
Usage: NIFTI is predominantly used in research settings, especially for functional MRI studies and other neuroimaging applications
